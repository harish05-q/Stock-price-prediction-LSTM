# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

A compact Jupyter Notebook project demonstrating how to predict stock closing prices using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The notebook walks through data loading, preprocessing, model training, and visualization of predictions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (scaling, windowing)
- LSTM model built with TensorFlow / Keras
- Train / validation split and basic evaluation
- Plots comparing actual vs predicted prices

## Quickstart
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or install pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow, yfinance).
2. Open and run the notebook `Stock_price_prediction.ipynb`.
3. Modify the ticker and date range to experiment with different stocks.

## Notes
- Results depend on data range, model hyperparameters, and randomness. This is intended as an educational demo, not financial advice.
